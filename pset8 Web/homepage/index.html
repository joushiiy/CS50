    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello my name is Joshua and I am from Singapore.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is part of my <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">CS50</a> webtrack assignment on
            how to build a basic homepage with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. CS50 is a introductionary course by Harvard
            for computer science and programming. I have been tasked with many assignments and used languages such as C, Python, SQL , HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before this I was an Airforce Engineer with the Republic of Singapore Airforce
            where I learned many mechanical skills as well as interpersonnal skills. As someone who absolutely hates asking for
            help I learnt here that nobody that can shoulder everything themselves sometimes I help my friends and sometimes they help me.
            First taste of real teamwork.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Why are you doing this course?
        </h4>
        <p>
            I want a job that allows me to use my creativity and problem solving skills which I inclined towards being a programmer.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Goals?
        </h4>
        <p>
            I hope to get into a respectable university. My dream is NUS after visiting the school and hearing about the facilities.
