    <h2>Airforce Engineer</h2>
    <p>
        For my conscription I was blessed with the opputunity to work in the Republic of Singapore Air Force(RSAF).
        It was an eye opening expirience to work with many dedicated pilots and engineers.
    </p>

    <h3>Flight Line Crew(FLC)</h3>

    <p>
        Worked on the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter. Daily task is doing checks on the Aircraft before and after each flight to ensure the airworthiness and safety of the aircraft.
    </p>

    <h4>What I learnt</h4>

    <h5>Responsibility</h5>
    <p>Signing an aircraft to be fit for flight is a heavy responsibility.
    At the start and the end of the day I have to ensure I have accounted for everything as foreign object debris is a major risk in aviation.</p>

    <h5>Teamwork</h5>
    <p>There are many task to be down throughout the day, sometimes I miss my meals and sometimes me friends do.
    Everyone started stepping up to offering help to each other so that we have sufficient rest. Everyone got closer together due to strong teamwork with one another.</p>

    <h5>Leadership</h5>
    <p>Learning to be in charge of my peers and juniors. Certain task that require more man or helping each other, redirecting people around to get the job done is a must.</p>

    <h5>Mechanical skills</h5>
    <p>On the aircraft itself, I got to see and use many techniques and tools I learnt about in school. I learnt many tricks of trades on how to deal with many situations when working on the aircraft. </p>
