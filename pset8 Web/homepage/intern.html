    <h2>Tools Engineering</h2>
    <p>In my internship I was placed in the tools engineering department in a company called Turbine Overhaul Services(TOS).
    The tooling deparment is responsible for designing tools to allow easier and more accurate inspection of aircraft turbine blades.
    During my time section was upgrading and experimenting with 3D printing technology.</p>

    <h3>Tools intern</h3>
    <p>My primary job was to help prepare engineering drawings to be sent out. I occasionally will salvage different scrapped tools for reusable parts.
    Experiment with the 3D printer to gain more expirience with it.</p>

    <h4>What I learnt</h4>

    <h5>Preperation of 3D drawings</h5>
    <p>I learned to prepare engineering drawings and how to draw them. My manager was kind and patient to teach me how I should place my measurements.
    She also taught me how to handle request to changes in drawings</p>

    <h5>AutoCad and Siemens NX</h5>
    <p>During some down times, I was tasked to practise 3D drawing. I am quite confident to 3D draw with any 3D drawing designs afte internship.
    For my FYP in school I was able to switch to Solidworks and helped my teammates with thier projects.</p>

    <h5>3D printing</h5>
    <p>I was allowed to use the 3D printer to make several plastic replacements for the cubicle covers that broke.
    The engineers guided me on certain shapes I need to know to incorparate into my design. I was encouraged to play with the density and the temperature.
    One tip is to know that different materials will work better with certain beds.</p>
